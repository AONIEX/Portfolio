One of my biggest projects is a game made for my 3rd year professional project class, which was then taken forward to Abertay's Dare Academy and is called Synaptic. This game was made as with a team of 8 and my role was the Weapons, UI, Interactions and Accesability Programmer. This project has helped with my team building skills, helping me stay in contact with team members and stick to deadlines. I also learned alot about the collabrative side of programming and how important it is to keep in contact with out professions to keep work flowing. For example keeping up to date with the animation team so we can link the animations to the code on time.

### Game Mechanics Programming Mesh Cutting (3rd Year University Project)
The project was made for Game Mechanics Programming (3rd Year Class), where i had to make a unique game mechanic in Unreal Engine 5 using C++ with minimal blueprint use. For this i decided to make a mesh cutting "Weapon" which allowed the player to cut out parts of a mesh, before being able to grab them and then return them to their original position if wanted.

### Ba Ba BANG! Sheep
Ba Ba BANG! Sheep is a first year project which i have grown and worked on when not working each summer. It started as a sfml game for PC but i quickly move it over to Unity and made the game work for both PC and Mobile, with the game currently having a downloadable android version. The game consists of a infinte procedurally generates level with platforms and enemies constantly spawning as the player tries to move up and get a new high score. This project taught me alot about prefabs, inheritance, parent classes and how to use them properly to stop myself from re writing code where avoidable. It has also shown me the imporatance of object management and performance, due to working with an "infintely" generated level.
