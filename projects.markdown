<br/> 
Synaptic is one of my biggest projects and is a game made for my 3rd year professional project class, which was then taken forward to Abertay's Dare Academy. This game was made as with a team of 8 and my role was the Weapons, UI, Interactions and Accesability Programmer. This project has helped with my team building skills, helping me stay in contact with team members and stick to deadlines. I also learned alot about the collabrative side of programming and how important it is to keep in contact with out professions to keep work flowing. For example keeping up to date with the animation team so we can link the animations to the code on time.

### Game Mechanics Programming Mesh Cutting (3rd Year University Project)


The project was made for Game Mechanics Programming (3rd Year Class), where i had to make a unique game mechanic in Unreal Engine 5 using C++ with minimal blueprint use. For this i decided to make a mesh cutting "Weapon" which allowed the player to cut out parts of a mesh, before being able to grab them and then return them to their original position if wanted.

### Ba Ba BANG! Sheep
Ba Ba BANG! Sheep is a first year project which i have grown and worked on when not working each summer. It started as a sfml game for PC but i quickly move it over to Unity and made the game work for both PC and Mobile, with the game currently having a downloadable android version. The game consists of a infinte procedurally generates level with platforms and enemies constantly spawning as the player tries to move up and get a new high score. This project taught me alot about prefabs, inheritance, parent classes and how to use them properly to stop myself from re writing code where avoidable. It has also shown me the imporatance of object management and performance, due to working with an "infintely" generated level.

## Game Jams
Before and during at university i have taken part in multiple game jams to refresh and improve my knowledge. The main thing i try to do every game jam is make each game unique, whether thats a new genre or different core mechanics as i believe this allows me to learn more in such a short amount of time.

### Game Jam Games
- ### Blue
  - Solo Project
  - Game Engine:Unity 
  - Blue was made for the Speed Jam #5 with a themes Speed Running and ASCEND. For this Project i wanted to work with lighting and ambience to give the game a nice feel and look whilst having minimal controls (Just a drag and click). I did this game alone, so worked on every aspect, and wanted to take a short break from coding to learn about the other aspects of game development as i believe it is important to understand what each department ahs to deal with

- ### The Reapers Garden
  - One of my First Game Jams
  - Solo Project
  - Game Engine: Unity
  - This was one of my first game jam games with a theme of 2 colours, no shades just black and white. I believe i learned the fundamentals of Unity for this project, when making this wave based game. I also chose to add a unique mechanics of collecting souls for the reaper to regrow their garden. This was quite a simple project but also allows me to show how far my skills have come.

- ### Skuffed
  - Team Project
  - Game Engine: Unity
  - This project was a team project i did in my 3rd year of university and i took it on myself to have a team of 3rd years so i can see how it is to help people learn and work wiwth less experience people. Even though i was working with lesss experienced people i still wanted to do something unique, so we decided to do a two player rigid body physics game, where you would control your oppents arms and your legs whilst trying to race towards a finish line and screw up your enemy.

- ### Fire Breathing Space Corgi
  - Team Project
  - Game Engine: Unity
  - This project was one of my first team projects in a game jam and was a big learning curve, figuring out how to learn with artists, level designers and audio designers. I focused on the core movements for the player and the AI for the enemies within the game, giving each of them unique mechanics, attacks and movement. For this i focused on state machines allowing an enemy to move between states based on if the enemy is close, what attack it wants to use and if it dies. I also made sure to re use this state machine for each enemy, making sure to re use the states that can re used.
