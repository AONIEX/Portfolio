### Hobbies
- DND (Dungeons And Dragons)
  - DND allows me to socilise and come up with unique and creative ideas for gaming or life in general. It lets my creativity flow and my ideas in a world of almost endless possibilities, which i belive is important for people to do in general. 
- Miniature Painting
  - Painting miniatures helps me relax and clear my mind in between projects, often giving me a fresh mind when i go back to my projects whilst still being creative in my down time.
- Video games
  - I sometimes play video games in my free time to relax me but also to keep up to date with the latest gaming trends and to give me new ideas for mechanics that i can learn to code. I can then also use these ideas to make unique mechanics in my own games and fix any errors that i have had in previous projects. 
- Game Jams
  - I take part in game jams when i have enough free time as i belive it allows me to keep my creativity thrive as well as allows me to keep up to date and learn new skills when im not studying. Game jams also keep me up to date on how to work in a team and different proffesions effieciently and conflict free.

### Recent Events

#### Dare Academy
During the Summer of 2025, Me and a team of 8 the Bonny Bandits became Dare Academy finalists with our game Systanpic, which we continued from our Des315 (University Professional Project). This oppurtunity allowed us to work with people in the game industry and get feedback on our ideas and approach to making the game. This also gave us the oppurtunity to show case our game at the Dundee Contemporary Arts (DCA)  its annual Drop-in and Play event, with the other 5 Finalists team. We are currently waiting for the awards ceremony and any further updates on our game.
